  <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
  <p>Here, I showcase my projects and skills.</p>
  
    <!--_________PROJECTS_________-->
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ABU ROBOCON 2019 - Autonomous Quadruped Robot</strong>
      <p>Designed an autonomous 4-legged walking robot for ABU ROBOCON 2019 for navigating the game field. My responsibility was to manufacture the components required for the robot.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>ABU ROBOCON 2020 - Rugby Playing Robot</strong>
      <p>Two robots were created to play rugby. The first robot picks up the rugby ball and passes it to the second. The second robot picks up the ball, places it on the ground, and kicks it toward the goal post. My responsibilities included designing and testing the mechanism for passing the ball from the first to the second robot. In addition, the mechanism must be built and mounted to the robot.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>ABU ROBOCON 2021 - Arrow Throwing Robot</strong>
      <p>Designed one robot to throw arrows in a pot. The robot has to pick up the arrows from an arrow rack and throw them into a pot that is in motion. My responsibilities were to coordinate with the design team and manufacture the robot during the pandemic situation.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>ABU ROBOCON 2022 - Lagori (Indian Game) Playing Robot</strong>
      <p>The aim of the project is to design two robots and play the Indian game of lagori in 2 rounds. Robot R1 throws balls to break the Lagori pile. The other robot R2 piles the Lagori discs. In the next round, robot R1 has to throw the ball to knock the ball on the head of the opponent robot while R2 passes the ball to R1. My responsibilities are to plan, organize, and guide the members for the design of the R1 robot.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Autonomous Mobile Robot</strong>
      <p>Designed and manufactured an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) which can either help carry some luggage/material or perform disinfection in an area by doing natural navigation and with minimal human interaction or help.</p>
    </li>
